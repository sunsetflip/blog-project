# Blog Project

This is a project I am creating in order to brush up on the skills and knowledge I have learned thus far in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

I started working through the Odin Project curriculum in 2022, but stopped in the latter half of the year due to various personal reasons.

I'm itching to jump back into learning web development and so I've made this blog/website to serve as a personal refresher for the skills I've picked up so far.

These skills currently consist of:
* navigating the terminal/command line
* writing HTML
* using Git
* styling in CSS
