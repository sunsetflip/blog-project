                    As an avid horror fan for most of my life now, I've consumed a <strong>lot</strong> of media in the genre. 
                    Throughout each October for the past decade, my husband and I try to watch one scary film each night. It 
                    honestly takes a lot for a work to genuinely "scare" me nowadays. I will say without exaggeration, 
                    however, that Masaaki Nakayama's <em>PTSD Radio</em> [also known as <em>Kouishou Radio</em>] is one of the 
                    downright creepiest and most unsettling comic series that I've read in a long time.

                    A five-volume series that spans 49 chapters (or 'parts'), <em>PTSD Radio</em> doesn't follow the rules of a 
                    traditionally linear narrative. Each chapter works as more of a stand-alone vignette or short story. The 
                    main story jumps between multiple different characters and sub-plots. Think of it as flipping through 
                    different frequencies on a radio. This will likely cause some disorientation and confusion for the reader 
                    initially - but as you read through this series, the short stories begin to intertwine and come together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main overarching story of <em>PTSD Radio</em> is pretty typical fare when it comes to Japanese horror. 
                    We gradually learn of an ancient totem and the "God of Hair" it symbolizes. As the chapters continue 
                    to unfold, the tale of this malevolent spirit and the vengeful curses it inflicts upon its victims begins 
                    to take shape. All of the stories take place in a single city, spanning different points in time. The 
                    non-linear structure essentially works to make each successive chapter a short, stand-alone ghost story. 
                    Fans of classic J-Horror films such as <em>Ring</em> and <em>Ju-On: The Grudge</em> will get a kick out of 
                    these spooky tales. One by one, the characters in this manga meet gruesome deaths in unexpected and 
                    creative ways.

            <p>The real shining gem of this series - and indeed, the source of much of its creepiness and nightmarish feel 
                - is Nakayama's art style. The character and creature design is top-notch. His fine-line drawing style and 
                use of shadows (particularly the strong contrasts between light and dark colours) add so much to the 
                reading experience. At times, dialogue is not even necessary; the facial expressions of the characters 
                create such a creepy feeling of tension. The timing of the "jump scares" (for lack of a better term) is 
                also one of the aspects of this series that I quite enjoyed. You may find yourself hesitating to turn to 
                the next page, not knowing if a startling panel or horrifying full-page spread awaits you...</p>

            <p>Highly recommended for fans of Junji Ito's work (although there is no dark humour to be found in this 
                series) and J-Horror films, <em>PTSD Radio</em> is a relatively short but satisfying read that will haunt 
                you long after it's over. I wouldn't necessarily say that the overarching story is amazing or original by 
                any means, but the tense atmosphere is guaranteed to leave readers feeling uncomfortable and unnerved.</p>
