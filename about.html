            <p>My name is Faye. My passions and interests include reading and writing; film; music; 
            horror; comics and manga; and professional wrestling.</p>
            <p>I used to blog on a relatively consistent basis back in 2010 to 2012. I've recently found myself itching 
                to seriously get back into writing in general. Thus, I've created this new blog to serve as a space for me 
                to write about a variety of topics. My current plans for articles mainly consist of reviews of some of the 
                notable manga and comics that I read last year - but I'd ultimately love to write about lots of different 
                things as time goes on.</p>
            <p>I am currently learning web development through <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> 
                and its curriculum. I figured why not use the skills I've picked up thus far to create my own blog/website 
                from scratch?</p>
